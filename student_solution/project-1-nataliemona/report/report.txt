    ***How do you write forwarding rules in the controller/controller_circle.py
    file, and why do those rules work to enable communications between each
    pair of hosts?***

    To create the circle, I simply added a connection between s1 and s3 to
    transform the line topology to circle topology.

    The connection between s1 and s3 is the last connection added so it is
    connected to s1's port 3 and s3's port 3.

    The forwarding rules in  `controller_circle.py` are:
    s1
        h1-> port 1
        h2-> port 2
        h3-> port 3 (changed from port 2 in line topology rules)

    s2
        h1-> port 2
        h2-> port 1
        h3-> port 3

    s3
        h1-> port 3 (changed from port 2 in line topology rules)
        h2-> port 2
        h3-> port 1

    The most efficient path from s1 to h3 is now s1->s3->h3.
    In the circle topology, there is now a direct connection between s1 and s3,
    the packet no longer needs to travel through s2 to reach s3.

    Similarly, the most efficient path from s3 to h1 is now s3->s1->h1.
    The packet can travel directly from s3 to s1 via the new connection.


    ***After running the applications, you can get the evaluation results.
    Please run both applications on all hosts, i.e., on host h1-h3.
    You will get average log(latency) of memcached requests,
    and average log(throughput) of iperf. Write these evaluation results
    in this file.***

    Average latency of Memcached Requests: 326.298075973 (us)
    Average log(latency) of Memcached Requests: 1.38808883839
    Average throughput of Iperf Traffic: 20219058.1005 (bps)
